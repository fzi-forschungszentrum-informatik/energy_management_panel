# EMP Locations App 

**This is work in progress!**

This app should allow users to interact with the energy management system at certain locations of a building. It is designed with non-residential buildings in mind and provides a set of widgets that can be assigned to the locations to provide a certain functionality like changing the setpoint temperature.
